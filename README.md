# Investing LLM 

Heard of the line "Mutual Funds are subject to Market Risk. Please read all scheme related documents carefully." ?
Well, These investing documents have so much legal jargon and with reduction in attention span, it becomes difficult to read out those documents carefully.

### Problems while reading Investment Documents
- Confusions in understanding the language of the document.
- Getting distracted and having to read multiple times.
- Short span of time to get the most out of the document.
- Hidden terms which may cost a lot in the long run.
- Hefty pages written by CA's and Lawyers with domain-specific knowledge that may not be understood by general audience.
