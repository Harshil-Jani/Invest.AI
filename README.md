# Investing LLM 

Heard of the line "Mutual Funds are Subject to Market Risk. Please Read all scheme related documents carefully." ?
Well, These investing documents have so much legalities and with reduction in attention span of millenial and genZ, 
It becomes difficult to read out those documents carefully.

### Problems while reading any investment schemes
- Confusions in understanding the documents.
- ADHD brains who goes blank and have to re-read multiple times.
- Short span of time to get most out of the document.
- Hidden terms which may cost us a lot in long run.
- Hefty pages written by CA's and Lawyers with basic human logic.
